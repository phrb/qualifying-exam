New architectures, variety of computational devices, hard to optimize.
Inflection points, exponential growth, technology change.
Look at code optimization from search perspective.
Old code, new code, can be optimized with search.

Different levels of a program's generation and usage can be optimized.
Some levels take longer to complete, expensive to measure.
Some architectures take longer to compile, expensive to measure.
Some problems take longer to solve, expensive to measure.
How to autotune complex systems such as HACC?
How to autotune programs for a supercomputer like the Titan?
How to autotune FPGA compilation?

Current approaches require multiple evaluations.
Current approaches have no support for parallel and distributed computing.
Current approaches do not target multiple levels of stack.

New approach must leverage distributed and parallel computing power.
New approach must target multiple levels of compile stack.
New approach must take care of expensive to measure cases.
